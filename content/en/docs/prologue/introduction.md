## Getting to know the Green Metrics Tool

We recommend that you start with the [Philosophy & Methodology â†’]({{< relref "philosophy-methodology" >}}) part 
to understand the *WHY* of the tool and some design decisions.

After that we recommend the [Measurement Process â†’]({{< relref "measurement-process" >}}) to get a high level overview
of *WHAT* the tool does and *HOW*.

From here you can branch off in two paths:

### Measure your own app with our online hosted service

[Measuring with our hosted service â†’]({{< relref "measuring-service" >}}) 

This is a one page summary of how to measure a sample application.

After that you can look at our [Example Apps Repository](https://github.com/green-coding-berlin/example-applications) to see some prepared apps that can be directly consumed.

Your app must conform to the [usage_scenario.yml â†’]({{< relref "usage-scenario" >}}) specification and be [Containerized â†’]({{< relref "containerizing-applications" >}})


### Install and measure locally
Under [Installation â†’]({{< relref "installation-overview" >}}) you find the detailed installation instructions.

Then proceed with [Containerizing and measuring own applications â†’]({{< relref "containerizing-applications" >}}) to understand
how to prepare your app to be consumed by the Green Metrics Tool.
